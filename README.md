# Tennis-Match-Project
The aim of this project was to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the winner of a men's tennis match. I obtained data for ATP matches played between 1995-2017 from Jeff Sackman's Github repository (https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp).

There were 3 key stages to this project:

- Data preparation (merging files, cleaning data and dealing with missing values)
- Feature engineering (creating new informative features using my domain knowledge of tennis)
- Modelling (training classification algorithms and evaluating their performance)


Project was initially completed in Feb 2018. Minor documentation and commenting changes have been added since then.
